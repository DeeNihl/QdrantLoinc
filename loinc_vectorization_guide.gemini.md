# LOINC Code Vectorization Guide: Semantic Block Framework

## Overview

This guide provides a standardized approach for organizing LOINC code information into semantic blocks optimized for vector embeddings and similarity search. The framework creates 10 distinct content blocks that address different search intents and user types.

## Core Principles

### 1. Semantic Coherence
- Each block focuses on a single semantic domain
- Related concepts are grouped together
- Information within blocks builds logically from general to specific

### 2. Self-Contained Context
- Each block can be understood independently
- Sufficient context is provided within each block
- Cross-references enhance but don't replace standalone clarity

### 3. Search Intent Optimization
- Different blocks target different types of queries
- Natural language variations are included
- Both technical and colloquial terms are balanced

### 4. Embedding Efficiency
- Optimal length for transformer models (typically 100-500 tokens per block)
- Keyword density balanced with readability
- Hierarchical information structure preserved
